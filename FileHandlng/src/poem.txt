In twilight's soft and tender glow,
Where dreams in shadows gently grow.
A moonlit dance, a whispered tale,
Of stars that in the night prevail.

Upon the canvas of the sky,
A lullaby, a cosmic sigh.
Each twinkling light, a distant plea,
A serenade for hearts carefree.

Through meadows dressed in silver sheen,
Where time slows down, and sights unseen.
The breeze, a poet's gentle rhyme,
A melody that knows no time.

Beneath the canopy of night,
The world aglow with soft delight.
In every verse, a secret shared,
A timeless moment, love declared.
